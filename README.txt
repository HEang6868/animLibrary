This is a basic animation pose library for Maya 2025.
It's still a work in progress.

It's built for animators to save all keyable attributes on either just the selecteed controls, or for all controls on a selected rig.
Upon running it for the first time it will create a folder in your Maya project to hold the data a thumbnails that you save with it.
